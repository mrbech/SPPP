#Introduction
The following report is Martin RÃ¸nning Bech's answer to the Programs as Data
(PRCPP) E2014 examination. It is split into  sections for each of the
question.

The code snippets for each of the questions can be found in the corresponding
question section, the code have been cut out of the Quicksorts.java file. The
complete source code can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:source_code} but should
not be needed to read this report. The code have been compiled and run on Arch
Linux using OpenJDK 1.8.0_25

#Question 1:
In this question we have to make the given *SimpleDeque* thread safe using
locks. To make the *SimpleDeque* thread safe we can apply the Java Monitor
Pattern, that is to make sure that any mutable state that is put in private
fields are guarded by the *SimpleDeque* object lock.

So in our *SimpleDeque* we ensure that *items*, *bottom* and *top* are private
and are *GuardedBy("this")*. We then make the public method's *push*, *pop* and
*steal* *syncronized*. These changes makes the *SimpleDeque* objects thread safe
by ensuring that only a single thread will ever be allowed to make updates to
their individual internal mutable state. 

The *GuardedBy("this")* annotations are added to all internal state that needs
to be guarded by the objects lock, this is to communicate to others that any
updates made to these fields must only be done when the *this* lock is taken, it
is also useful in combination with tools that can be used to detect if the
correct lock is always taken when access are made to the fields.

```java
@GuardedBy("this")
private long bottom = 0;
@GuardedBy("this")
private long top = 0;
@GuardedBy("this")
private final T[] items;

public synchronized void push(T item) {...}
public synchronized T pop() {...}
public synchronized T steal() {...}
```

#Question 2
The *SortTask* is an immutable object, this is done by making all the fields
*final*. By being immutable we ensure that after its creation no one can update
the instance, so we can safely pass it around in different threads. Any thread
that needs to do an "update" of the *SortTask* will instead have to create a new
instance with the updated values.

#Question 3
In this question we implement a multi threaded Quicksort that uses a single
shared queue to communicate sorting tasks. I how broken my code into three
functions: *singleQueueMultiThread* that runs a small test case and prints it to
the console, *sqmtWorkers* that starts the worker threads, *sqmtWorker* that
contains the code for a single worker thread. Below I will explain how each
function works, afterwards I will show a tests run and finally I will explain
why the implementation is thread safe.


The *singleQueueMultiThread* implementation found below is quite simple, it
creates a *SimpleDeque* instance and an array with random integers we want to
sort (using the *randomIntArray* method given with the assignment). It then
prints the array before sorting using the *IntArrayUtil.printout* method given
with the assignment, runs the *sqmtWorkers* sorting method and finally prints
the resulting array and the result of running *isSorted* helper method given
with the assignment.

```java
private static void singleQueueMultiThread(final int threadCount) {
    System.out.println("Running singleQueueMultiThread");
    SimpleDeque<SortTask> queue = new SimpleDeque<SortTask>(100000);
    //int[] arr = IntArrayUtil.randomIntArray(size);
    System.out.println("Before:");
    int[] arr = IntArrayUtil.randomIntArray(20);

    IntArrayUtil.printout(arr, 20);

    queue.push(new SortTask(arr, 0, arr.length-1));
    sqmtWorkers(queue, threadCount);

    System.out.println("After:");
    IntArrayUtil.printout(arr, 20);

    System.out.println("Sorted:");
    System.out.println(IntArrayUtil.isSorted(arr));
}
```

The *sqmtWorkers* implementation takes a *Deque* and a *threadCount*. It then
creates a *LongAdder* instance for keeping track of the amount of ongoing work.
It then spawn *threadCount* amount of *sqmtWorker* threads and finally waits for
them all to finish.

```java
/**
 * Function for starting singleQueueMultiThread workers
 */
private static void sqmtWorkers(Deque<SortTask> queue, int threadCount) {
    //Initialize ongoing counter with the size of the queue
    //We assume the queue only has a single task
    LongAdder ongoing = new LongAdder();
    ongoing.increment();

    //Creating threads:
    Thread[] threads = new Thread[threadCount];
    for(int t = 0; t < threadCount; t++){
        //Start the thread
        threads[t] = new Thread(()-> sqmtWorker(queue, ongoing));
        threads[t].start();
    }

    //Wait for the threads to finish
    for(int t = 0; t < threadCount; t++){
        try{
            threads[t].join();
        }catch(InterruptedException e){}
    }
}
```

The *sqmtWorker* implementation works by first getting a new task (using the
helper *SortTask* helper method given by the assignment, that first tries to
take a task from the queue, if there are none left it will see if there is any
ongoing worker, if there is it yield the thread to wait for more work to appear
in the queue, if there isn't any ongoing work it will return null). 

If the worker gets a task it will take the information from the task, if the
array needs to be partitioned ($a < b$) it will do so and finally add two new
sorting tasks to the queue, as well as increment the ongoing counter after each
task has been added. Finally when so work have been done (partitioned or not) it
will decrement the ongoing counter. 

We are ensured that the entire thing will terminate because by the end all tasks
should no longer need to be partitioned and the ongoing counter will therefore
be decremented to zero.

```java
/**
 * Function for a singleQueueMultiThread worker
 */
private static void sqmtWorker(Deque<SortTask> queue, LongAdder ongoing){
    SortTask task;
    while (null != (task = getTask(queue, ongoing))) {
        //We have a task now partition!
        final int[] arr = task.arr;
        final int a = task.a, b = task.b;
        if (a < b) { 
            int i = a, j = b;
            int x = arr[(i+j) / 2];         
            do {                            
                while (arr[i] < x) i++;       
                while (arr[j] > x) j--;       
                if (i <= j) {
                    swap(arr, i, j);
                    i++; j--;
                }                             
            } while (i <= j); 

            //Increment the counter when pushing
            queue.push(new SortTask(arr, a, j));
            ongoing.increment();
            queue.push(new SortTask(arr, i, b));
            ongoing.increment();
        }
        //We have sorted something, time to decrement
        ongoing.decrement();
    }
}
```

Below output from running the *singleQueueMultiThread* method with 8 threads can
be seen. As expected the array is sorted.

```
Running singleQueueMultiThread
Before:
38 1 12 30 27 19 15 18 33 6 13 11 28 25 12 4 38 33 29 7 
After:
1 4 6 7 11 12 12 13 15 18 19 25 27 28 29 30 33 33 38 38 
Sorted:
true
```

So the array gets sorted, the implementation is thread safe because (1) the
queue object we are using is thread safe a task will never be delegated to more
than one thread and multiple accesses to the queue will never break the queue,
and (2) the worker threads will never accesses the same part of the array at the
same time this is due to the nature of the quick sort algorithm, notice that at
any given time there will only ever exists a task (recursive step in the normal
algorithm) going from some $a$ to some $b$ and there will be no overlap.

#Question 4
In this question we write tests for the *SimpleDeque* implementation implemented
in Question 1. First we write a sequential test that tests that the
*SimpleDeque* works as expect using only a single thread. Then we write a
parallel tests that tries to tests if the implementation works when accessed by
multiple threads.  For the tests I have used the *assertEquals* and *assertTrue*
methods given in the course material from week 9 as well as introduced two new
helper methods *assertNull* and *awaitBarrier* all the helper methods can be
found in appendix \ref{appendix_helper_methods}.

In the *sequentialDequeTest* we test that the general functionality of the
given *Deque* works. First we tests that *pop* and *steal* will return *null*
when the *Deque* is empty. We then tests that putting a single element into the
queue will make *pop* return it again and again testing that using *pop* now
will yield *null* we do this for *steal* as well. Finally we fill the queue with
3 element and tests that *steal* will give the element first inserted and *pop*
will give the element last inserted. These tests should cover the general
functionality of the *Deque*.

```java
static void sequentialDequeTest(Deque<Integer> queue) throws Exception{
    //Check that it only returns null
    assertNull(queue.pop());
    assertNull(queue.steal());

    //Check that pop/push works on single insert
    queue.push(42);
    assertEquals(42, queue.pop());
    assertNull(queue.pop());

    //Check that steal work on single insert
    queue.push(43);
    assertEquals(43, queue.steal());
    assertNull(queue.pop());

    queue.push(44);
    queue.push(45);
    queue.push(46);

    //Check that steal takes from the back
    assertEquals(44, queue.steal());

    //Check that pop takes from the front
    assertEquals(46, queue.pop());
    
}
```

Now comes the *parallelDequeTest*. In this tests we start 4 kind of threads:

* Pushing threads that will *push* one million random integers between 0-9999 into
  the *Deque*
* Popping threads that will *pop* one million integers from the *Deque*
* Stealing threads that will *steal* one million integers from the *Deque*
* Main thread that starts all the threads, waits and checks the result.

Each of the different kind of threads will have local *long* sum counter that
they will continuously update when the have pushed, popped or stolen a value
from the *Deque*. When they have completed their work they will add their local
*long* sum value to a shared *LongAdder* between the threads. The threads are
synchronized using a *CyclicBarrier* so they wait for all threads to have
started and completed. The idea here is to try an force the test to go through
as many different code interleavings as possible.

The main thread starts all the threads, it then waits first for all of them to
start then for all of them to finish. After all threads have completed it
empties to *Deque* and sums the remaining values. The implementation then sums
the sum of the remaining values, the sum of the values popped and the sum of the
values stolen and compares the result with the sum of the values pushed. 

```java
static void parallelDequeTest(Deque<Integer> queue,
     int threadCount) throws Exception {
    CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier((threadCount*3)+1);
    int pushedSum = 0;
    
    //Start pushing threads
    LongAdder pushed = new LongAdder();
    for(int t = 0; t < threadCount; t++){
        final int lt = t;
        new Thread(()->{
            awaitBarrier(barrier);
            long p = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++){
                Random random = new Random();
                int r = random.nextInt() % 1000;
                p += r;
                queue.push(r);
            }
            pushed.add(p);
            awaitBarrier(barrier);
        }).start();
    }

    //Start pop threads
    LongAdder popped = new LongAdder();
    for(int t = 0; t < threadCount; t++){
        final int lt = t;
        new Thread(()->{
            awaitBarrier(barrier);
            long pop = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++){
                Integer p = queue.pop();
                if(p != null){
                    pop += p;
                }
            }
            popped.add(pop);
            awaitBarrier(barrier);
        }).start();
    }
    //Start stealing threads
    LongAdder stolen = new LongAdder();
    for(int t = 0; t < threadCount; t++){
        final int lt = t;
        new Thread(()->{
            awaitBarrier(barrier);
            long s = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++){
                Integer p = queue.steal();
                if(p != null){
                    s += p;
                }
            }
            stolen.add(s);
            awaitBarrier(barrier);
        }).start();;
    }

    //Start test
    awaitBarrier(barrier);
    //Wait for the test to stop
    awaitBarrier(barrier);

    //Get the remaining sum
    long remaining = 0;
    Integer p = queue.pop();
    while(p != null){
        remaining += p;
        p = queue.pop();
    }

    //Get the sum of the threads
    long pushedsum = pushed.sum();
    long retrievedsum = remaining + popped.sum() + stolen.sum();

    //Check that sum matches
    assertEquals(retrievedsum, pushedsum);
}
```
I have run the tests on my *SimpleDeque* implementation multiple times using
different amount of threads and it seems to pass every time.

To see if these tests will actually be able to find errors in my implementation
I have done the following mutations of my implementation:

* Removed the statement that adds the *item* to the *items* list in the *push*
  method, this gets caught by the sequential test.
* Removed the decrement of *bottom* in the *pop* method, this gets caught by
  the sequential test.
* Removed the increment of *top* in steal, this gets caught by the sequential
  test.
* Different permutations of removing the *syncronized* keyword from *push*,
  *pop* and *steal*. All permutations was found by the parallel test.


#Question 5
In this question we measure the wall clock time of the sorting process in the
single-queue multi-threaded Quicksort from Question 3. First we show the
implementation of the measurement code and then what execution time it produces.

The *bencmarkSingleQueueMultiThread* method is a simple method that calls the
benchmarking method with threadcount $1...8$ as well as printing the result to
the console in a table like format.

```java
public static void benchmarkSingleQueueMultiThread(){
    System.out.println("Threads\tTime");
    for(int i = 1; i<9; i++){
        double time = sqmtBenchMarkVersion(i);
        System.out.println(i + "\t" + time);
    }
}
```

The *sqmtBenchMarkVersion* is the actual benchmark methods. This method takes a
thread count, creates an instance of the SimpleDeque, an array of 50 million
random integers, the ongoing counter and then starts all of the *sqmtWorker*
threads.  It uses a *CyclicBarrier* to ensure that all of the threads starts at
the same time and to start the timer after the threads have started execution
and stopping after all threads are done, this is to avoid measuring the thread
startup time. In the main thread we therefore wait for all threads to start,
start the timer, wait for the threads to finish and stop the timer returning the
resulting time.
```java
public static double sqmtBenchMarkVersion(int threadCount){
    SimpleDeque<SortTask> queue = new SimpleDeque<SortTask>(100000);
    int[] array = IntArrayUtil.randomIntArray(50_000_000);
    queue.push(new SortTask(array, 0, array.length-1));
    CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(threadCount+1);

    //Initialize ongoing counter with the size of the queue
    //We assume the queue only has a single task
    LongAdder ongoing = new LongAdder();
    ongoing.increment();

    //Creating threads:
    Thread[] threads = new Thread[threadCount];
    for(int t = 0; t < threadCount; t++){
        threads[t] = new Thread(()->{
            awaitBarrier(barrier);
            sqmtWorker(queue, ongoing);
            awaitBarrier(barrier);
        });
        //Start the thread
        threads[t].start();
    }

    //Waiting for threads
    awaitBarrier(barrier);
    //Threads started
    Timer t = new Timer();
    awaitBarrier(barrier);
    //Threads done
    return t.check();

}
```

I have run the tests on a Linux machine with 2 cores (4 hyper-threaded),
compiled and run with OpenJDK Java 8. Below is the resulting table of sorting 50
million integers using 1 to 8 threads. The measurements shows first a decrease in
performance and then a slight increase, the extra overhead of all threads
accessing the same queue does seem to some degree hinder the execution time of
this implementation.

Threads Time (Seconds)
------- -------- 
1       12.340515302
2       16.846127914
3       17.464326595
4       17.812679099
5       12.014321464
6       12.175678324
7       12.185204746
8       12.476405772

The test is obviously no completely accurate, but it does show something about
the performance of the implementation. There are however a few things to note:

* Its only a single sorting run. We do not repeat and average.
* Its only shows the execution time on my specific machine.
* It might be influenced by the software running on my machine.
* It might be influenced by JVM optimizations, especially in the later runs.

#Question 6
In this question we create a multi-threaded multi-queue Quicksort. I will first
show my implementation and explain why it works. I will then show the output of
running the implementation.

The *multiQueueMultiThread* is very similar to the *singleQueueMultiThread* (see
Question 3) method, but instead it creates a list of SimpleDeques.

```java
private static void multiQueueMultiThread(final int threadCount) {
    System.out.println("Running multiQueueMultiThread");
    SimpleDeque<SortTask>[] queues = new SimpleDeque[threadCount];
    for(int i = 0; i < threadCount; i++){
        queues[i] = new SimpleDeque<SortTask>(100000);
    }
    //int[] arr = IntArrayUtil.randomIntArray(size);
    System.out.println("Before:");
    int[] arr = IntArrayUtil.randomIntArray(20);
    IntArrayUtil.printout(arr, 20);


    queues[0].push(new SortTask(arr, 0, arr.length-1));
    mqmtWorkers(queues, threadCount);

    System.out.println("After:");
    IntArrayUtil.printout(arr, 20);
    
    System.out.println("Sorted:");
    System.out.println(IntArrayUtil.isSorted(arr));
}
```

The *mqmtWorkers* is similar to *sqmtWorkers* (see Question 3). It now takes a
list of *Deque* and assigns each thread worker a number thereby assigning each
worker a *Deque* from the list. An interesting point here is that the first
thread will initially be the only thread gets a task, it will then partition
and the other threads will be able to steal the new tasks from it.

```java
private static void mqmtWorkers(Deque<SortTask>[] queues, int threadCount) {
    //Initialize ongoing counter with the size of the queue
    //We assume the queue only has a single task
    LongAdder ongoing = new LongAdder();
    ongoing.increment();

    //Creating threads:
    Thread[] threads = new Thread[threadCount];
    for(int t = 0; t < threadCount; t++){
        //Start worker thread
        final int myNumber = t;
        threads[t] = new Thread(()-> mqmtWorker(queues, myNumber, ongoing));
        threads[t].start();
    }

    //Wait for the threads to finish
    for(int t = 0; t < threadCount; t++){
        try{
            threads[t].join();
        }catch(InterruptedException e){}
    }
}

The *mqmtWorker* method is almost identical to the *sqmtWorker* (see Question
3). It however uses the overloaded *getTask* method and pushes tasks to its
assigned *Deque*.

```java
private static void mqmtWorker(Deque<SortTask>[] queues, int myNumber,
        LongAdder ongoing){
        SortTask task;
        while (null != (task = getTask(myNumber, queues, ongoing))) {
            //We have a task now partition!
            final int[] arr = task.arr;
            final int a = task.a, b = task.b;
            if (a < b) { 
                int i = a, j = b;
                int x = arr[(i+j) / 2];         
                do {                            
                    while (arr[i] < x) i++;       
                    while (arr[j] > x) j--;       
                    if (i <= j) {
                        swap(arr, i, j);
                        i++; j--;
                    }                             
                } while (i <= j); 

                //Increment the counter when pushing
                queues[myNumber].push(new SortTask(arr, a, j));
                ongoing.increment();
                queues[myNumber].push(new SortTask(arr, i, b));
                ongoing.increment();
            }
            //We have sorted something, time to decrement
            ongoing.decrement();
        }
} 
```

The new *getTask* method now first tries to *pop* a task from the threads own
queue, if this returns empty it will try to steal from all the other queues if
it fails it will yield, finally it will check the ongoing value and if this is
zero it will return null otherwise it will try to steal again. 

The reason why this will terminate at some point is that a worker will only ever
push to it's own queue and we can therefore assume that we will have to try to
stealing until we find something or there is not more work and then we can
conclude that we are finished, because when we are in the stealing loop that
directly means there are no tasks in our queue. Other than that the points from
Question 3 still applies.

```java
private static SortTask getTask(final int myNumber, final Deque<SortTask>[] queues, 
        LongAdder ongoing) {
    final int threadCount = queues.length;
    SortTask task = queues[myNumber].pop();
    if (null != task) 
        return task;
    else {
        do {
            //Lets try to steal a task from someone...
            for(int i = 0; i < queues.length; i++){
                if(i != myNumber){
                    task = queues[i].steal();
                    if(task != null){
                        return task;
                    }
                }
            }
            Thread.yield();
        } while (ongoing.longValue() > 0);
        return null;
    }
}
```

Below output from running the  *multiQueueMultiThread* method with 8
threads can be seen. As expected the array is sorted.

```

#Question 7
In this question we have to measure the wall clock running time of the
multi-queue multi-threaded Quicksort implementation from Question 6. First I
show my measurement code I then show the result of running the measurement code
on my machine and finally I comment on the differences between the execution
time of the multi-queue multi-threaded Quicksort with results of running the
single-queue multi-threaded Quicksort in Question 5.

The *benchmarkMultiQueueMultiThread* method simply creates the list of
*SimpleQueues* and calls the benchmarking method with thread count from 1 to 8
and prints the result to the console in a table like format.

```java
private static void benchMarkMultiQueueMultiThread() {
    System.out.println("Threads\tTime");
    for(int i = 1; i<9; i++){
        SimpleDeque<SortTask>[] queues = new SimpleDeque[i];
        for(int t = 0; t < i; t++){
            queues[t] = new SimpleDeque<SortTask>(100000);
        }
        double time = mqmtBenchMarkVersion(i, queues);
        System.out.println(i + "\t" + time);
    }
}
```

The *mqmtBenchMarkVersion* method is similar to the *sqmtBenchMarkVersion*
method from Question 5. It uses a *CyclicBarrier* to synchronize the execution
start the threads and only starts the timer when all the threads have been
started to avoid measuring the thread start overhead. It waits for all the
threads to finish and then returns the resulting time.

```java
private static double mqmtBenchMarkVersion(int threadCount,
    Deque<SortTask>[] queues) {
    int[] array = IntArrayUtil.randomIntArray(50_000_000);
    queues[0].push(new SortTask(array, 0, array.length-1));
    CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(threadCount+1);

    //Initialize ongoing counter with the size of the queue
    //We assume the queue only has a single task
    LongAdder ongoing = new LongAdder();
    ongoing.increment();

    //Creating threads:
    Thread[] threads = new Thread[threadCount];
    for(int t = 0; t < threadCount; t++){
        final int myNumber = t;
        threads[t] = new Thread(()->{
            awaitBarrier(barrier);
            mqmtWorker(queues, myNumber, ongoing);
            awaitBarrier(barrier);
        });
        //Start the thread
        threads[t].start();
    }

    //Waiting for threads
    awaitBarrier(barrier);
    //Threads started
    Timer t = new Timer();
    awaitBarrier(barrier);
    //Threads done
    return t.check();
}
```

I have run the tests on Linux machine with 2 cores (4 hyper-threaded), compiled
and run with OpenJDK Java 8 (Same as in Question 5). Below is the resulting
table of sorting 50 million integers using 1 to 8 threads. The table shows a
decent performance gain from adding multiple threads until 4 threads are added
it then stays around the same execution time.

Threads Time
------- ----------
1       12.465767929
2       6.606346842
3       6.595644916
4       7.033794127
5       5.883259311
6       6.057786901
7       5.285766619
8       5.159242964

For a short discussion of reasons why these tests is not accurate see Question 5.
From this benchmark we see a clear benefit from adding more threads to the
multi-threaded multi-queued Quicksort in comparison to the single-queued
multi-threaded approach. The reason for this is most likely that we have reduced
the actual overhead from the threads having to access the same queue all the
time, with this implementation we mostly access our own queue and then sometimes
when we run out of work steal from someone else. 

I will also note that this implementation shows better performance on a single
thread, but this is most likely purely by chance.


#Question 8

```java
class ChaseLevDeque<T> implements Deque<T> {
    volatile long bottom = 0; 
    final AtomicLong top = new AtomicLong(0);
    final T[] items;

    public ChaseLevDeque(int size) {
        this.items = makeArray(size);
    }

    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") 
    private static <T> T[] makeArray(int size) {
        // Java's @$#@?!! type system requires this unsafe cast    
        return (T[])new Object[size];
    }

    private static int index(long i, int n) {
        return (int)(i % (long)n);
    }

    public void push(T item) { // at bottom
        final long b = bottom, t = top.get(), size = b - t;
        if (size == items.length) 
            throw new RuntimeException("queue overflow");
        items[index(b, items.length)] = item;
        bottom = b+1;
    }

    public T pop() { // from bottom
        final long b = bottom - 1;
        bottom = b;
        final long t = top.get(), afterSize = b - t;

        if (afterSize < 0) { // empty before call
            bottom = t;
            return null;
        } else {
            T result = items[index(b, items.length)];
            if (afterSize > 0) // non-empty after call
                return result;
            else {		// became empty, update both top and bottom
                if (!top.compareAndSet(t, t+1)) // somebody stole result
                    result = null;
                bottom = t+1;
                return result;
            }
        }
    }

    public T steal() { // from top
        final long t = top.get(), b = bottom, size = b - t;
        if (size <= 0)
            return null;
        else {
            T result = items[index(t, items.length)];
            if (top.compareAndSet(t, t+1))
                return result;
            else 
                return null;
        }
    }
}
```

#Question 9
In this question we write tests for the *ChaseLevDeque* implemented in Question 8.
First we write a parallel test that only pop/pushes in one thread and steals in
multiple threads. We then run the sequential test from Question 4 and our new
parallel test on the *ChaseLevDeque*.

First we have the *runTestChaseLevDeque* method that sets up and runs the
*sequentialDequeTest* from Question 4 and our new *parallelCLDequeTest* test on
the *ChaseLevDeque*.

```java
static void runTestChaseLevDeque() throws Exception {
    System.out.println("Running ChaseLevDeque Tests");
    ChaseLevDeque<Integer> cl = new ChaseLevDeque<Integer>(100_000_000);
    sequentialDequeTest(cl);
    ChaseLevDeque<Integer> cl2 = new ChaseLevDeque<Integer>(100_000_000);
    parallelCLDequeTest(cl2, 10);
    System.out.println("ChaseLevDeque Tests Completed");
}
```

The *parallelCLDDequeTest* is a modified version of the *parallelDequeTest* from
Question 4. This test still uses *CyclicBarrier* to synchronize the thread
starts, and it still compares the sum on values push on the queue with the sum
of the values popped, stolen and remaining in the queue after the test run. 

The big differences between this test and the test in Question 4 is that we now
only have a single thread that pushes and pops. So to try and force as many
different code interleavings between the stealing threads and the push/pop
thread I have introduce some randomness to the execution. So in the push/pop
threads we randomly either do push or pop.

```java
static void parallelCLDequeTest(Deque<Integer> queue,
         int threadCount) throws Exception {
    CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(threadCount+2);
    int pushedSum = 0;
    
    //Start pushing and popping thread
    LongAdder pushed = new LongAdder();
    LongAdder popped = new LongAdder();
    new Thread(()->{
        awaitBarrier(barrier);
        long p = 0;
        long pop = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < 10_000_000; i++){
            Random random = new Random();
            if((random.nextInt() % 2) == 0){
                int r = random.nextInt() % 100;
                p += r;
                queue.push(r);
            }else{
                Integer pp = queue.pop();
                if(pp != null){
                    pop += pp;
                }
            }

        }
        pushed.add(p);
        popped.add(pop);
        awaitBarrier(barrier);
    }).start();

    //Start stealing threads
    LongAdder stolen = new LongAdder();
    for(int t = 0; t < threadCount; t++){
        final int lt = t;
        new Thread(()->{
            awaitBarrier(barrier);
            long s = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < 10_000_000; i++){
                Integer p = queue.steal();
                if(p != null){
                    s += p;
                }
            }
            stolen.add(s);
            awaitBarrier(barrier);
        }).start();;
    }

    //Start test
    awaitBarrier(barrier);
    //Wait for the test to stop
    awaitBarrier(barrier);

    //Get the remaining sum
    long remaining = 0;
    Integer p = queue.pop();
    while(p != null){
        remaining += p;
        p = queue.pop();
    }

    //Get the sum of the threads
    long pushedsum = pushed.sum();
    long retrievedsum = remaining + popped.sum() + stolen.sum();

    //Check that sum matches
    assertEquals(retrievedsum, pushedsum);
}
```

Running the sequential test on the *ChaseLevDeque* passed without errors.Running
the parallel test with different numbers of threads and different numbers of
push/pop and steal operations have all passed without errors on the current
implementation of the *ChaseLevDeque*.

To see if these tests will actually be able to find errors in the implementation
I have done the following mutations of the implementation:

* Removed the statement that adds the *item* to the *items* list in the *push*
  method, this gets caught by the sequential test.
* Made the *top.compareAndSwap* if statment in *pop* into a *top.set(t+1)*, was
  caught by the parallel test.
* Made the *top.compareAndSwap* in *steal* into a *top.set(t+1)*, was caught by
  the parallel test.

#Question 10
In this question we must used the *ChaseLevDeque* from Question 8 with the
multi-threaded multi-queue Quicksort from Question 6. We will first show the code
and then the output of running the code.

Below is the code used to run the *ChaseLevDeque* with the multi-threaded
multi-queue Quicksort. It is also identical to the code from
*multiQueueMultiThread* from Question 6, except it now creates a list of
*ChaseLevDeque*.

```java
private static void multiQueueMultiThreadCL(final int threadCount) {
    System.out.println("Running multiQueueMultiThreadCL");
    ChaseLevDeque<SortTask>[] queues = new ChaseLevDeque[threadCount];
    for(int i = 0; i < threadCount; i++){
        queues[i] = new ChaseLevDeque<SortTask>(100000);
    }
    //int[] arr = IntArrayUtil.randomIntArray(size);
    System.out.println("Before:");
    int[] arr = IntArrayUtil.randomIntArray(20);
    IntArrayUtil.printout(arr, 20);


    queues[0].push(new SortTask(arr, 0, arr.length-1));
    mqmtWorkers(queues, threadCount);

    System.out.println("After:");
    IntArrayUtil.printout(arr, 20);

    System.out.println("Sorted:");
    System.out.println(IntArrayUtil.isSorted(arr));
}
```

Below is the output of running the code above, sorting the list as expected.

```

#Question 11
In this question we have to measure the wall clock running time of the
multi-queue multi-threaded Quicksort using the *ChaseLevDeque* implemented in
Question 8. First we show the implementation used, then we show the measurements
made and finally we compare the measurements with the measurements of the other
implementations.

The measurements code found in *benchmarkMultiCLQueueMultiThread* method is very
similar to the code found in *benchMarkMultiQueueMultiThread* method from
Question 7 and uses the *mqmtBenchMarkVersion* method from Question 7. It
creates a list of *ChaseLevDeque* and calls the benchmarking method with thread
count from 1 to 8.

```java
private static void benchMarkMultiCLQueueMultiThread() {
    System.out.println("Threads\tTime");
    for(int i = 1; i<9; i++){
        ChaseLevDeque<SortTask>[] queues = new ChaseLevDeque[i];
        for(int t = 0; t < i; t++){
            queues[t] = new ChaseLevDeque<SortTask>(100000);
        }
        double time = mqmtBenchMarkVersion(i, queues);
        System.out.println(i + "\t" + time);
    }
}
```

I have run the tests on Linux machine with 2 cores (4 hyper-threaded), compiled
and run with OpenJDK Java 8 (Same as in Question 5). Below is the resulting
table of sorting 20 million integers using 1 to 8 threads. The table shows a
decent performance gain from adding multiple threads until 4 threads are added
it then stays around the same execution time.

Threads Time
------- ----------
1       11.295220809
2       6.124706902
3       5.452502169
4       5.026470204
5       5.349917083
6       4.809790837
7       5.006808109
8       4.948741356

For a short discussion of reasons why these tests is not accurate see Question 5. 

Comparing with the benchmarks performed in Question 5 and Question 7, there is
no doubt that this solution still provides better performance over the
single-queued multi-threaded solution. It also seems to provide slightly better
performance that using the *SimpleDeque* not by a lot but enough to make it
significant and it will probably even scale better on machines with more cores.
The downside to using this queue is obviously how easy it is to make mistakes.
As described in Question 8 even the pseudo implementation given with this exam
had sublet small errors in the code.
